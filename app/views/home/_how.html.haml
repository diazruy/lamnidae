              First and foremost, you get a commitment to quality. Code is delivered
              with comprehensive automated tests and utmost care is
              given to using best-practices, appropriate design patterns
              and documentation. I take pride in what I produce and do not
              take shortcuts when it comes to quality.

              I am a firm believer in providing users with the smoothest,
              most painless experience. When users can't figure something out,
              it is usually not their fault, it is the interface's fault.
            %p
              For this reason, I will help you to provide the best UX possible.
              Over ten years in web development allows me to have a good feel for
              interaction design and I will work with you and your user testing
              to hone in on the best results possible.
